This repository houses solutions to some of the first 100 project euler problems, except written in SQL.
I did this not only because it's funny, but also because it's a decent way to learn SQL.

All "programs" are written for `sqlite3` and can be run as `sqlite3 < pXX.sql`.

Feel free to contribute solutions!  But only solutions to the first 100 problems should be shared, and
note that all solutions are placed into the public domain under the CC0 license included.
